# Genetic Algorithm
## Infinite monkey theorem
The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. In fact, the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times. However, the probability that monkeys filling the observable universe would type a complete work such as Shakespeare's Hamlet is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe is extremely low

## Use Genetic Algorithm to find the given text
It is possible to find the target words by using brute force algorithm but it will takes massive amount of time. A better alternative will be using Genetic Algorithm as it will use the natural selection process to accelerate the amount of time taken to find the target words.
