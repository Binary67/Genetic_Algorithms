# Genetic Algorithm 
Genetic Algorithm reflects the process of natural selection. Only the fittest individuals from a population will be selected for reproduction. The process keeps repeating and every generation will be better than previous generation

Genetic Algorithm consists of 4 processes:
1. Generate Population
2. Natural Selection based on Fitness Function
3. Mutation and Crossover
4. Generate New Population

## Optimizing Weights and Biases For Neural Network
Back-propagation is the most commonly used technique to train a neural network. The idea of this project is to use natural selection process to find the weights and biases that have low cost function.
